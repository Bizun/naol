			</h2>

				⌨️ Microprocessors are at the heart of every modern digital device, from your phone to your computer. In fact, as of 2016, microprocessors accounted for more than 60% of the world’s total installed base of processors. And that’s not all: because microprocessors are so versatile and powerful, they can be found in a wide range of products and services, from cars to medical devices.
				where do these microprocessors come from? Well, most of them are made in the United States – in fact, the US is now responsible for more microprocessor production than any other country in the world. This impressive feat is thanks in part to the country’s well-educated workforce and world-class research institutions. In addition, US companies have been able to compete fiercely on price thanks to strong manufacturing competitiveness and a supportive government environment.

		 Vaccum Tube
		 </h3>
		  <p style="font-size: 10px;">
		  ⌨️ A vacuum tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating.

        Evolution of Sensors
      </h4>
		  <p style="font-size: 10px;">
		  ⌨️Sensors have a very wide range, and there are many types, but fundamentally, sensors are devices that detect the feature quantity of a measurement object and convert this quantity into a readable signal, which is displayed on an instrument. And sensing technology, simply put, is a technology that uses sensors to acquire information by detecting the physical, chemical, or biological property quantities and convert them into readable signal.

           ARM
      </h5>
		  <p style="font-size: 10px;">
		    ⌨️ ARM (stylised in lowercase as arm, formerly an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines and originally Acorn RISC Machine) is a family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments. Arm Ltd. develops the architectures and licenses them to other companies, who design their own products that implement one or more of those architectures, including system on a chip (SoC) and system on module (SOM) designs, that incorporate different components such as memory, interfaces, and radios. It also designs cores that implement these instruction set architectures and licenses these designs to many companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products.
